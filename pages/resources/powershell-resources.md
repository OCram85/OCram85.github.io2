# The Basics

In this section you find the most basic stuff. It's aimed to help beginners who just got in touch with powershell.
All external links refer to the latest production ready Powershell version. This is currently the version `5.1`.

* [Official Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell) - Microsoft recently moved all the
  Powershell documentation to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com).
* [Powershell Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting?view=powershell-5.1)
  If you need details about specific function or cmdlets you can find it there. The Reference is grouped by the built
  in modules. You can expand each group and select the individual help page of each function.
* [About Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_aliases?view=powershell-5.1)
  The docs does not only contain a reference of all the built in function. It also contains the so called *About* pages.
  These pages explain specific concepts and language related topics. You can find them in a separate *about* section
  of the **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core** module reference. The titles always starts with *about_* and the specific name.

{: .box-note}
<i class="fa fa-commenting icon-blue" aria-hidden="true"></i> **NOTE:** You can also display the *about_* pages with
a powershell function. To get a list of all about pages just use `Get-Help about_*`. All you need to to is pick
a topic name and use the function again like this: `Get-Help about_Functions`.

## Start using it!

You can't learn Powershell like every other language if you don't use it. So try to solve basic tasks with Powershell.
Google around or ask questions in communities like:

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/powershell)
* [Powershell.org](https://powershell.org/forums)

# Intermediate

Once you got familiar with the basic powershell concepts start discovering advanced techniques like *functions*,
*modules*, *classes*, *types*, *Extended Type System*, *Powershell Remoting*, *jobs*, *Package Management*.

## Tools

In this phase you should also start working with additional tools like

* VCS (Version Control System):
  * [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/)
* additional Editors, IDEs:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* CI/CD Environments:

recommend using [Github](https://github.com/) in combination with [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/). You don't
need to maintain any additional infrastructure and they are absolutely free.
